Liberforce is my nick on the web. You may askyourself where this stupid nick comes from. Or not.  
-   a\) This is how my friends call me
-   b\) This is a name made up from "libre" (*free* as in freedom infrench) and "force", to actually carry the idea of the force of freedom ingeneral, and more precisely in the software world.
-   c\) It's the first answer I found to the question "How will you be known asamong the gods?" in the "Populous II" game, back when I was 12, in my old Amiga500 days
