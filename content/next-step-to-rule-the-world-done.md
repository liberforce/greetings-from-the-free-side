Yup, Mandriva Linux 2008.1 Spring has been released today. What is amazingis that it's been released on time, which hasn't been the case for years !

I've started testing it quite late in this development cycle (RC2), but Istill was able to find a few annoying bugs, which were corrected on time,thanks to Mandriva's hard working team. While I was a bit disapointed with2008.0 (and 2007.0), what I saw pleased me, ans I really think this release isMandriva Linux at its best (200X.1 releases seem to be better at Mandriva).

Everything you should know about it is here:
