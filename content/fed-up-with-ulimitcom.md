A few years back, I was looking for a free (as in free beer) mail/webredirection service. [Ulimit.com](http://www.ulimit.com/) was a goodchoice back then. But they have been annoying me a lot for the last year. Theybecame more and more intrusive with their ads. Thay started showing xxx-relatedads for your web visitors (I  didn't see it, but saw someone complainabout that on a website).  
  
Because of that, I stopped using the old web redirections I had from them. Butnow it's the e-mail forwarding quality of service that troubles me.**Sometimes, emails just don't reach me at all**. Not always, butit seems that I couldn' t receive a mail on my main adress for the last 2-3days. So dear [Lazyweb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LazyWeb), I'mnow looking for a new, as free (as in freedom *and* beer) as possible,web and mail forwarding service. Do you know any (possibly France hosted, orwith access in french as ulimit)?  
  
**Edit:**  
I've looked to the providers of that kind of service I know:  
*Dyndns.com*: MailHop Forward Lite for \$29.95 / year (5 accounts)  
*no-ip.com*: Mail Forwarding, \$34.95 / year (5 accounts)  
*uucpssh.org*: Free service closed, or 30€ / 6 months
