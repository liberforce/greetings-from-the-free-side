Wow ! I've just understood what may be the origin of the word ["smoketesting"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing) , that I readfor the first time when used for GNOME smoketesting versions ![
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing)It seems to be derivatedfrom the [magic bluesmoke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_smoke)...
