Wow ! I've just understood what may be the origin of the word ["smoketesting"](\%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing\%22) , that I readfor the first time when used for GNOME smoketesting versions ![  
](\%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing\%22)It seems to be derivatedfrom the [magic bluesmoke](\%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_smoke\%22)...
