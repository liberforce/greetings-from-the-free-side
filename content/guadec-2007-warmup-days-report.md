Here is a small overview of the conferences I liked this year at GUADEC.

*Disclaimer:* If yours is not there, either

-   I was busy elsewhere
-   I have nothing to say about it
-   I found it bad :-)Â 

Warmup (15-16 of July):
-----------------------

[Free Software for the socially excluded](http://www.guadec.org/node/665)

Kind of interesting to see how the english educational system works when you
come from a different country. The speaker gave us some insightful information
about how giving a computer to a child in the UK could improve his chances to
have his graduation. He could explain us how thin clients with remote access
via ssh for maintenance, and some cheap USB sticks could help a *lot*of people.
It seems that the english system doesn't help children, and uses the old
**"survival of the ~~fittest~~ richest"** mode to determine who is able to
learn, work, or breathe. It's a pity that we, in France are going towards this
direction.

[Gnome Memory Use: Naming and Shaming the Culprits](http://guadec.org/node/586)

[Exmap-console](http://projects.o-hand.com/exmap-console),presented last year
at GUADEC is back. It helped us to see in a nice, living presentation what the
greater offenders in terms of memory are. The theme cache came quite high on
the profile. Last year, the talk was about using exmap-console in a remote,
embedded environment, but this time was more about a simple howto for desktop
profiling.

I'm quite happy that [Pascal Terjan](http://fasmz.org/~pterjan/) was there, as
I could ask him to package it for [Mandriva
Linux](http://www.mandriva.com/download) (the last time had tried,I couldn't
install it from source).

[Screensaver Sanity](http://guadec.org/node/576)

A fairly technical talk, but interesting ! In fact it made me discover that
multi-user environment, fast user switching, and session management are very
difficult to get right. The main information I caught is that a new GDM, almost
entirely written from scratch, and improving the situation should appear next
year.

[Technical Challenges when using Electronic Paper Displays with
GTK](http://guadec.org/node/636)

First time I could hold an [electronic
paper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper) device in my hands. The
product has some advantages, the biggest being its astonishing readability: no
flickering, good contrast. It also has at the moment a good amount of
disadvantages. Among them, you can't update just a portion of the screen, and a
full screen update takes around 1 second. I'm not sure this will be able to
compete with the upcoming [OLED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oled) technology,
but I wish iRex all the best.

Here are some pictures:
