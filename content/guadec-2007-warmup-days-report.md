Warmup (15-16 of July):
-----------------------

[Free Software for the sociallyexcluded](http://www.guadec.org/node/665)

Kind of interesting to see how the english educational system works when youcome from a different country. The speaker gave us some insightful informationabout how giving a computer to a child in the UK could improve his chances tohave his graduation. He could explain us how thin clients with remote accessvia ssh for maintainance, and some cheap USB sticks could help a *lot*of people. It seems that the english system doesn't help children, and uses theold **"survival of the ~~fittest~~ richest"** mode todetermine who is able to learn, work, or breathe. It's a pitty that we, inFrance are going towards this direction.

[Gnome Memory Use: Naming and Shamingthe Culprits](http://guadec.org/node/586)

[Exmap-console](http://projects.o-hand.com/exmap-console),presented last year at GUADEC is back. It helped us to see in a nice, livingpresentation what the greater offenders in terms of memory are. The theme cachecame quite high on the profile. Last year, the talk was about usingexmap-console in a remote, embedded environment, but this time was more about asimple howto for desktop profiling.

I'm quite happy that [PascalTerjan](http://fasmz.org/%7Epterjan/) was there, as I could ask him to package it for [Mandriva Linux](http://www.mandriva.com/download) (the last time had tried,I couldn't install it from source).

[Screensaver Sanity](http://guadec.org/node/576)

A fairly technical talk, but interesting ! In fact it made me discover thatmulti-user environment, fast user switching, and session management are verydifficult to get right. The main information I caught is that a new GDM, almostentirely written from scratch, and improving the situation should appear nextyear.

  

[Technical Challenges when usingElectronic Paper Displays with GTK](http://guadec.org/node/636)

First time I could hold an [electronic paper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper) device inmy hands. The product has some advantages, the biggest being its astonishingreadability: no flickering, good contrast. It also has at the moment a goodamount of disadvantages. Among them, you can't update just a portion of thescreen, and a full screen update takes around 1 second. I'm not sure this willbe able to compete with the upcoming [OLED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oled) technology, but I wish iRex allthe best.

  
Here are some pictures:
