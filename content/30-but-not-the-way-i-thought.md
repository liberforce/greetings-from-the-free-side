Long time no blog, but as everyone does it, I've got to announce (a bitlate) that I turned 30 a few days ago, on November 1st. These days have been abit tough, as my grandmother deceased the day just before. She would haveturned 94 years on November 20th. I was sad of course, but she lived well, anddidn't suffer in her last days. She had a peaceful detah; my mother told me shevanished as a candle you blow.

Thanks to all the friends and family that supported me.

I was nonetheless happy to celebrate my birthday on saturday 8th with mysisters and friends, some of them having never been in my new home, wich Ientered... 8 months ago. I should really get some time to have a kitchen...
