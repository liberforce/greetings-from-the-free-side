Long time no blog, but as everyone does it, I've got to announce (a bit late)
that I turned 30 a few days ago, on November 1st. These days have been a bit
tough, as my grandmother deceased the day just before. She would have turned 94
years on November 20th. I was sad of course, but she lived well, and didn't
suffer in her last days. She had a peaceful death; my mother told me she
vanished as a candle you blow.

Thanks to all the friends and family that supported me.

I was nonetheless happy to celebrate my birthday on saturday 8th with my
sisters and friends, some of them having never been in my new home, wich I
entered... 8 months ago. I should really get some time to have a kitchen...
