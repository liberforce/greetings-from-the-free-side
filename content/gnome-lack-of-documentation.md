GNOME lacks documentation. Everyone knows it. Sure. But we are in 2007 andthere are still [people starting to learn GNOME by starting with CORBA](\%22http://gnomesupport.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=52253&sid=3748ae926f92152415b3086e5358a114#52253\%22).  
  
Moreover, the book about GNOME the most pointed out to learn GNOME is ["The Official GNOME 2 Developer's guide"](\%22http://nostarch.com/gnome.htm\%22).I've just learned today that this book uses a (mostly) free licence: it usesthe [Creative CommonsNonCommercial-ShareAlike 1.0](\%22http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0/\%22) licence. However, it seems there is no onlineversion of this book (p2p excepted, I heard). This means no one can correct thebook that is beginning to become a bit outdated, thanks to project Ridley andother things. Also, I've bought this book, but I don't have any electronicversion to search information in it, which is also quite a bit annoying.  
  
I just hope that the upcoming library.gnome.org project, and that the [www.gnome.org revamp](\%22http://desdeamericaconamor.org/blog/node/340\%22) thatQuim Gil is leading will help newbies with that, so that they can easily knowwhere to start, what is up to date, and what is updated....
