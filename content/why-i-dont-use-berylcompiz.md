Although I'm a Mandriva user, [this post of Lucas Nussbaum's](http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=223)from planet Ubuntu retained my attention. Using the fact that Linux needs 3Deffects and proprietary drivers to face Windows is just a bad idea. Sure itadds some nice visual, is nice to show to friend so they can say "God, this guyis good at the computers thingy".  
  
But in fact, rotating cubes don't make me feel better when I use my computer,and I just miss the "always on top" function of Metacity when I use compiz.That's why I keep my 2D desktop.  
  
This "always on top" option is a great thing, and I find it far more useful inthe way I use my computer. Our (the OSS community) aim should just be toimprove the user experience, and maybe we could then achieve to do things in adifferent way than Microsoft or Apple. Stop copying. Just listen to users...and create.  
  
Proprietary drivers is not the subject of this rant. The subject is just thatit should (or should not) be just a mean and not a goal. The real goal is tohave users feel comfortable with a simple-to-understand desktop environment onLinux. Don't forget that for 90% of the users, computers are just a tool.  
  
The user wants a system that is simple, just works, and does not stop workingas time goes without reason (often seen on Windows). He doesn't want to hearabout maintainance, security, backups, software updates. So please, think aboutaverage Joe. He may try your software. And maybe switch because it's simpler,or better. Or because it's different.
