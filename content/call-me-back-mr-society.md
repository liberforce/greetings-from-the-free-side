I like computers. Diversity of them. But I just plainly hate cell phones. No
matter how many features they have, I just hate them, because most of the
phones, with that many features don't even achieve to perform well in their
main task: just being a phone. I mean: calling and receiving calls. Being able
to quickly access to your contacts list and call someone in a few seconds after
you turn it on.

Other features are also great, and would encourage me to buy that phone:

-   low radiance (burning my brain the less it can)
-   low pollution (being the less polluant it can)
-   high speed (responsive user interface)
-   easy to use (doesn't use [this kind of user
 interface](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/19b.html))
-   low cost

But no. People like GPRS, and surfing the web with a 2 inches screen (really,
my cousin wants it). People want to watch TV on this lousy screen. And games.
And remote command. And what-the-hell you could ever imagine. And then, they
complain they have low battery.

According to my cousin, i'm left at "Stone Age". Well I'm proud of it! I
personnaly think that cell phones can be very useful, but it has also terrible
drawbacks, especially (but not only) on teenagers. Addictance is one of them
(as in every communicating tool nowadays).

What does TV on your mobile can give you, except the same old crap you have in
your home TV? Why don't you read a book instead? Teenagers here were already
bad at orthograph because of the "global method". Now, they're even worse: SMS
language just kicked them even lower. Embedded cameras have filmed "happy
slappings", rapes, and other violent acts. People now film someone in trouble
instead of helping him. C'mon. Is that this world you want for you children?

Don't misunderstand me, these are bad aspects of technology, so this isn't just
a cell phone rant. But in the last 5 years, I've seen much more bad influences
and uses with cell phone than with any other communication tool. And I just
don't like the shape things are taking.
