I like computers. Diversity of them. But I just plainly hate cell phones. Nomatter how many features they have, I just hate them, because most of thephones, with that many features don't even achieve to perform well in theirmain task: just being a phone. I mean: calling and receiving calls. Being ableto quickly access to your contacts list and call someone in a few seconds afteryou turn it on.  
  
Other features are also great, and would encourage me to buy that phone:

-   low radiance (burning my brain the less it can)
-   low pollution (being the less polluant it can)
-   high speed (responsive user interface)
-   easy to use (doesn't use [this kind of userinterface](\%22http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/19b.html\%22))
-   low cost

But no. People like GPRS, and surfing the web with a 2 inches screen (really,my cousin wants it). People want to watch TV on this lousy screen. And games.And remote command. And what-the-hell you could ever imagine. And then, theycomplain they have low battery.  
  
According to my cousin, i'm left at "Stone Age". Well I'm proud of it! Ipersonnaly think that cell phones can be very useful, but it has also terribledrawbacks, especially (but not only) on teenagers. Addictance is one of them(as in every communicating tool nowadays).  
  
What does TV on your mobile can give you, except the same old crap you have inyour home TV? Why don't you read a book instead? Teenagers here were alreadybad at orthograph because of the "global method". Now, they're even worse: SMSlanguage just kicked them even lower. Embedded cameras have filmed "happyslappings", rapes, and other violent acts. People now film someone in troubleinstead of helping him. C'mon. Is that this world you want for you children?  
  
Don't misunderstand me, these are bad aspects of technology, so this isn't justa cell phone rant. But in the last 5 years, I've seen much more bad influencesand uses with cell phone than with any other communication tool. And I justdon't like the shape things are taking.
