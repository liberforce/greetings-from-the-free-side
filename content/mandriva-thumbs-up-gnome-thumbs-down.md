Mandriva 2009 Spring has been out for a few days now. Congratulations toeveryone involved ! I did my upgrade this week end, all in graphical mode with`mdkapplet`. I had [some bad luck](https://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50557), which wasfortunately quickly repaired. What you need to know is that using a 23MB /bootpartition is a bad idea, it's way too small if you keep a few kernels around.Once things were sorted out, I could enjoy the gorgeous design (Yay for that[tribal-penguinwallpaper](http://linuxbidouille.com/2009/03/07/theme-mandriva-20091/) !), and everything went fine.

The new GNOME mixer replaced the old one automagically, and It works great.The only problem I have with it is that it's a notification icon and not anapplet anymore. I hope this will change : [**notification area is not made for permanent things**](http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/desktop-notification-area.html.en). And Inow am unable to have the mixer react to a scroll button action if I put it inthe corner of the screen and move my mouse at it. Fitt's law failure. Beingable to change the volume without the need to power on my screen was a featureI liked.

Another sad news for GNOME is the choice of Mandriva to stick tonavigational nautilus by default instead of GNOME default's spatial nautilus. Ilike spatial nautilus. Yep. But what sucks is that it was made the defaut, buta [major defect](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=350474#c1) wasnever corrected : left an middle click comportment in opening a new foldershould have been inverted. This would have helped remove this bad reputation of"Windows 95"-like mode which does nothing except open a lot of windows. Havingto double-middle click to avoid cluttering my screen with windows is also whatled me to switch to single click policy. GNOME is supposed to be easy to useeven for the beginners. But *real* beginners have already a hard time todouble click without moving the mouse, so asking them to double-middle click isway too difficult. Really. I find it difficult for me and I don't exactlydefine me as a beginner. Oh, and try that on a laptop or a netbook, you'll loveit, especially on those netbooks like the first Acer Aspire One with one buttonon each side of the touchpad...

One good thing however is the new description for the session manager: Itotally agreed with [vuntz](http://www.vuntz.net/)when he told me that normal people don't know what a session is. I stillremember the first time, being a bit lost and unable to guess what that stuffwas supposed to do from its name in the menus.

Also, speedboot seems to work nicely : I've bootcharted my system before andafter migration, and `gdmgreeter` now appears in 20s instead of26s.

All in all, I'm quite happy with what I see. This time the rough edges arenot that rough. This Mandriva release really makes me feel at home. I'll behappy to install it at the next install parties in Paris ;-).
