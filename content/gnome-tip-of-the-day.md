**Avoiding turning your screen on to raise/lower sound on yourcomputer.  
  
**I have a CRT screen at home. When I listen to some musicwithout being in front of the computer, I turn the screen off, to avoid uselesspower consumption. However, I don't like using my speakers' buttons to regulatethe sound level. I prefer to do it by software, but i'd need to turn the screenon again to do that.  
  
So here is my GNOME tip of the day:  
  
*Step 1: move your mixer applet to onecorner*  
So I moved the mixer applet at the top right cornerof my desktop (works for every corner). For that, you need to unlock the mixerapplet and every applet that would prevent it from going on the destop corner.To move the applet, use the traditionnal middle mouse drag-and-drop.  
  
*Step 2: turn your screen off  
  
Step 3: move you mouse trying to go to the corner were you put the mixerapplet  
  
Step 4: roll your mouse wheel up or down to raise/lower the sound.*
