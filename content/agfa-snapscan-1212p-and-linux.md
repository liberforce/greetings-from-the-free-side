I just wanted to try to install an old piece of harware I've got here: anAGFA Snapscan 1212p. My ex-girlfriend gave it to me one year ago, and I nevertried it. Now, I just thought such an old crap would just work out of the boxwith my Mandriva 2007. But no? It seems that the 1212p (parallel port version)has no driver for linux, whereas the 1212u (USB version) has good support, asseen on the [SANEproject website](\%22http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html#Z-AGFA\%22).  
  
It seems the struggle to have manufacturers open their specifications is farfrom being over, even for outdated hardware..  
  
This one is going to be [freecycled](\%22http://www.freecycle.org/\%22)..
