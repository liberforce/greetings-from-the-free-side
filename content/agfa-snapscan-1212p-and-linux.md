I just wanted to try to install an old piece of harware I've got here: an AGFA
Snapscan 1212p. My ex-girlfriend gave it to me one year ago, and I never tried
it. Now, I just thought such an old crap would just work out of the box with my
Mandriva 2007. But no? It seems that the 1212p (parallel port version) has no
driver for linux, whereas the 1212u (USB version) has good support, as seen on
the [SANEproject website](http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html#Z-AGFA).

It seems the struggle to have manufacturers open their specifications is far
from being over, even for outdated hardware..

This one is going to be [freecycled](http://www.freecycle.org/)..
