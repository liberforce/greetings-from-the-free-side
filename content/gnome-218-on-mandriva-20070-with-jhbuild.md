[GNOME 2.18](\%22http://www.gnome.org/start/2.18/\%22) has been releaseda few days ago. However, I still haven't seen it running.... I'm too lazy todownload [ForesightLinux](\%22http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/foresight/release?id=5451\%22), and it seems that the Mandriva One with GNOME 2.18 is only availablefor x86\_64 users... Too bad for my Athlon XP 3000+.  
  
Anyway, I just achieved to compile almost the whole GNOME desktop from jhbuildtonight. Only a few modules are missing, some because they are hard to compilewith 2007.0 (NetworkManager, network-manager-applet), others just because Ijust don't care about them (mozilla, evolution-exchange, libexchange). Mozillain particular is so huge that I just always skip it.  
  
For the braves that will dare to compile the GNOME desktop on their Mandriva2007.0, I have just updated my guidelines about the [jhbuild dependenciesfor GNOME on Mandriva Linux](\%22http://live.gnome.org/JhbuildDependencies/MandrivaLinux\%22).  
  
Enjoy.
