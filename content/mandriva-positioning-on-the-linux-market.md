Here's an insightful [vision of the current Linux distro's market](http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2008/04/21/red-hat-novell-canonical-and-the-free-software-desktop), from [Dave Neary](http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh), former member of the[GNOME foundationboard](http://foundation.gnome.org/about/).

> I don’t want to pick on Mandriva, but it’s true that right now they’reaiming for the general consumer, the enterprise desktop **and**the enterprise server, and are not competing particularly well with thefront-runners in any of those markets.

And I agree with him. Even if there was some good progress on the generalconsumer market, the short/mid/long-term strategy is still unclear...

PS: I also noticed that the free (as in beer) mention about Mandriva Onedisapeared from the [frenchdownload page](http://www.mandriva.com/fr)... I'm pretty sure it was there before...
