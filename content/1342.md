This is my [final rank](http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=3716) (among
7897 contestants) on the last Artificial Intelligence challenge on
[aichallenge.org](http://aichallenge.org). That is not the best result ever,
and I'm a bit disapointed as I was aiming for the top 500 but I'm fairly new to
the AI world...

I definitely had difficulties in chosing between developping my own algorithms
or seeing what was seen as interesting directions to explore, like the
[anti-objects](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/%7Eralex/papers/PDF/OOPSLA06antiobjects.pdf)
approach.  Being a noob in the AI field, the Wikipedia articles on path finding
algorithms were extremely useful, as well as some Linux Magazine articles on
the same field.

Unfortunaltely, I became less active a few weeks before the end, as a work
colleague had a much better program on his first attempt, while I still had
worked a great amount of time on that... Good lesson for next time: the only
competitor I'm trying to surpass is myself. The end of the contest being at
Christmas, I couldn't try to catch up, as I was late in buying the Christmas
presents too :-).

The version that was used for the final tournament was version 12, even if I
had since then done some small improvements and bug fixing. The whole code is
available on [github](https://github.com/liberforce/termite), under the [WTFPL
2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) license.

My overal stats:

-   1342 amont 7897 (top 17% of contestants - with an undefined amount of
    really active contestants)
-   77th French contestant among 295 (top 27%).
-   35th C user among 248 (top 15%)

I learned a lot of things and had lots of fun, so expect me to come back on the
next contest, with better basics ;-)
