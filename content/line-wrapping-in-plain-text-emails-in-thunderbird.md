Disabling line wrapping in text emails I send is one of the first settings Ichange on every installation on a new machine. This way emails sent to mailinglists are much easier to read, especialy on web archives. But I always forgetwhich key need to be modified, so here's a little reminder for me, and anyonewho doesn't like to read huge lines of non-wraped text. You need to set to`false` the key `mailnews.send_plaintext_flowed`.
