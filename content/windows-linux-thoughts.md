Almost 5 years have passed since I erased my Microsoft Windows partitions toswitch to [Mandriva Linux](http://www.mandriva.com) (Mandrakelinux9.1 at that time). And I never regretted it. However, I try to keep myselfinformed of what happens in the Windows world, just to be able to helprelatives when they're in trouble. So I keep an eye of all the stuff I don'tuse on Linux: anti-spywares, anti-adwares, anti-viruses, anti-everything.

Yesterday, I had a Windows box to cure. Randomly, some Internet Explorerwindows would pop up, and bring the whole machine down to its knees, eating afew hundred megabytes of memory, and causing lots of swapping. I could downloadFirefox, then killed all the iexplore.exe processes, and was able to browse theweb to find a new antivirus and antispyware to see what was going on. UsingFirefox, no ads appeared.
All this made me remember why Windows is a nightmare to maintain.

Here's what I was painfully reminded:

Finding what is wrong is extremely time consuming. If you're not the personwho installed the program, you have no way to know from what the "add/removeprograms" tells you, what a program really does. No description. No file list.Nothing. So you can't just uninstall everything that has a name you don'tknow/like. You're then left to hours and hours of scanning, in the hope thatyou chose the right tools, and that they will detect the annoying software thatcauses the problem. Well in fact, it didn't happen. Neither the antispyware notthe antivirus could catch it.

What was utterly annoying, was the fact that I left the computer on thewhole night to let the antivirus perform a complete scan, but that this pieceof sh\*t just stopped at 35% to show a popup asking me what it should do withthe virus it had found (in a quarantine zone of an older antivirus). I reallywould have preferred it had scrolled the whole disk and asked me afterwards, orthat it had taken a temporary decision for me just to ask me all the questionsat the very end. But no. You have to stay if from of the antivirus, or comeregularly during the 4 hours it will scan the 146GB of data stored on the disk.Nice.

So, after a few hours of scanning the hard drive, I got sick of that andstopped the scans. Looking at the name on the popup's title bar, I could find aclue to determine from the configuration panel what was the name of theannoying crapware. That was an MSN Messenger addon. Uninstalling it, everythingwent fine again. Well, excepting the normal Windows "rot" problem. Having towait for so long to just have my computer started would make me mad. That makesme think that for 90% of normal Windows users, Linux would indeed start quicklyenough. A freshly installed Windows box boots faster, but after 2 months ofinstalling/uninstalling software, Linux wins hands up.

Sometimes, I think of what the Linux distros landscape would be if itreached a critical mass, like 20% of the desktop world. Will those threatsshatter my tranquility again ? People using a computer just install everysoftware they can find, and Linux won't change that I think. So even if usingonly Free Software protects me, third party vendors will start distributingcrapware to inexperimented users, and all this will start over again...

For the moment, I enjoy just being a dumb user that just wants somethingthat works. And Linux distros are currently good at that, even if I thinkthey're still too focused on what in new instead of what is bug-free. Butoverall, these last 5 years have been a much funnier experience using FreeSoftware. Software that you use, and make you feel that there's real peoplebehind it. And that they care about you. The biggest difference I see betweenthese two worlds now is that in the Windows/proprietary world, by default, youcan't trust that new software you haven't heard about before. In the Linux/FreeSoftware world, by default, you trust it, because having the source, even ifyou don't read it, is a mark of trust. Hope this will never change.
