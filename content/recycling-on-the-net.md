Another good way to recycle things is [Freecycle](http://www.freecycle.org/).
People just give out anything. You can too, when for example [your CD cases
become too cumbersome](http://davyd.livejournal.com/204444.html). I still
didn't achieved to get something (too slow to answer), but hope to get some old
PCs to switch to Linux.
