Another good way to recycle things is [Freecycle](\%22http://www.freecycle.org/\%22). People just give out anything. Youcan too, when for example [your CD cases become toocumbersome](\%22http://davyd.livejournal.com/204444.html\%22). I still didn't achieved to get something (too slow to answer),but hope to get some old PCs to switch to Linux.
