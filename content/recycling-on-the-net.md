Another good way to recycle things is [Freecycle](http://www.freecycle.org/). People just give out anything. Youcan too, when for example [your CD cases become toocumbersome](http://davyd.livejournal.com/204444.html). I still didn't achieved to get something (too slow to answer),but hope to get some old PCs to switch to Linux.
