These last months have been intense... I turned 30, found a new girlfriend,went to the Caribbean (Martinique, Dominica) for hollidays, and ended my workat the RATP (french public transports) after 5 years being there. I attendedFOSDEM in Brussels and met with a few GNOMEys there. It has been morecomplicated to find time for bug reporting/slaying and I've been mostly idle inthe free software front. This isn't going to change anytime soon, as I'mlooking for a new job (my current employer isn't specialized in softwaredevelopment and I expect no carreer opportunities from him). Furthermore, it'sbeen one year since I moved to my new appartment, but I still have no kitchen,no washing machine, and the electrical installation isn't finished, so there'sstill a lot to do.

At least I know what to do during the days I'm home...
