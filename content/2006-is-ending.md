...And my parents came back from Portugal to spend the holidays with their 3
childs and 3 grandchilds. Of course, as always, they came back with some great
food! My parents are retired and since then, were back to their roots:
agriculture. So I could taste theses oranges, sweet potatoes they cultivate:-)

Soooo good.

Yes, I'm the son of a lower-class worker, and proud of it :-D
