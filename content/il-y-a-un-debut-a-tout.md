Here I am... I wanted a blog to have some visibility in the GNOME world, andcommunicate in an easier way than in mailing lists. You surely don't know me,so here is some background info:

-   I'm a 27 years old french guy
-   I'm a software developer, currently struggling at work with glib,autotools, C, python, subversion
-   I'm a former Windows GUI developer (using MFC)... Yes, I'm ashamed :-)
-   I leaned everything I know about free software on my working and free time,not at school (they sucked for that)
-   I use Linux since Mandrake 9.1, and have used each version since then(excepted Mandrake 9.2)

My involvement in GNOME is irregular. Small patches to Gedit, Ekiga, some[GnomeGoals](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals) stuff, and mostlysome wiki work, as [JoinGnome](http://live.gnome.org/JoinGnome)or  [JhbuildIssues](http://live.gnome.org/JhbuildIssues). Ialso maintain the [JhbuildDependencies/MandrivaLinux](http://live.gnome.org/JhbuildDependencies/MandrivaLinux)page, and give a shot on Jhbuild on Mandriva Linux. It seems I'm the only guyto use MandrivaLinux on [jhautobuild](http://jhbuild.bxlug.be/). I'malso a moderator on the [GNOMEfrench forums](http://fr.gnomesupport.org/forums/)., thanks to Damien Durand ([splinux](http://glive.tuxfamily.org/blog/)).

What I like in GNOME? Simplicity. What I dislike in GNOME ? Well, I think i'llpost some rants to let you know :-)
