For those who don't know what I'm talking about, here is [part1](/post/2007/01/09/Recycling-an-old-machine-for-gcompris-part-1).

Well, after numerous badblocks attempts, I've seem that badblocks was trickingme. I first thought that some block of the hard disk were dead. But in fact, itwas only parts on the previous display that weren't deleted. The disk was okafter all.

Then I tried to install Mandriva 2007 on the machine. Well, it finally was apain in the ass. Installation is sooooo much longer than expected. I wouldn'thave never thought a Celeron 366 was that slow, because my first Mandrivainstall was Mandrake 9.1 on a Pentium II 350. My Celeron experience isdefinitely more painful (but the distro is bigger, so the proc is not the onlyone to blame).

I then have understood this fact: GNOME will be too heavy for this machine. SoI tried another install, in text mode, and installing only the base system,without X. I then think of configuring my **urpmi media** toinstall XFCE**.** It's a pitty Mandriva doesn't support thisenvironment out of the box (it's available in the **contrib**media, not in **main**).

So I now need to connect that machine to my network to be able to install XFCE.Maybe the best way to go at first was a net install... I don't know. But I hopeXFCE will be light enough for this old machine.
