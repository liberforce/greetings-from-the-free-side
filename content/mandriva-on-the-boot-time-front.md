It's nice to see that [Mandrivais working on shortening the boot time](http://blog.crozat.net/2008/09/improving-boot-time-on-general-linux.html). Even if we're not at a 5 secondsboot (which, I agree with fcrozat, is unreal - what people should ask for isflawless resume instead), I've seen on [some of his](http://people.mandriva.com/%7Efcrozat/bootchart/) [bootchart](http://www.bootchart.org/) graphs a 10% speedup which is cool.As it's been a long time since I didn't use bootchart, and tried it again andbenchmarked [myMandriva 2008.1/GNOME system](http://hardware4linux.info/system/3032/), in case it's useful for someone.

Here it is:
