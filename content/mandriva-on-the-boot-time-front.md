It's nice to see that [Mandriva is working on shortening the boot
time](http://blog.crozat.net/2008/09/improving-boot-time-on-general-linux.html).
Even if we're not at a 5 seconds boot (which, I agree with fcrozat, is unreal -
what people should ask for is flawless resume instead), I've seen on [some of
his](http://people.mandriva.com/~fcrozat/bootchart/)
[bootchart](http://www.bootchart.org/) graphs a 10% speedup which is cool.As
it's been a long time since I didn't use bootchart, and tried it again and
benchmarked [my Mandriva 2008.1/GNOME
system](http://hardware4linux.info/system/3032/), in case it's useful for
someone.

Here it is:
