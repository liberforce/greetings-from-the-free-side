I'll be on holidays Friday night, and ready for Berlin on Saturday morning,where I'll stay at the [H2 Hotel Berlin - Alexanderplatz](\%22http://maps.google.fr/maps?q=H2+alexanderplatz+hotel+berlin&hl=fr&ll=52.541911,13.423233&spn=0.097302,0.264187&fb=1&gl=fr&cid=0,0,1377265534286529175&z=13\%22). I'm really happy to meet again with goodfriends of the GNOME French Conspiracy :-p. I attended several GUADECs, butthis is my first Desktop Summit, so I hope to meet other desktops' users anddevelopers. This time I'll bring some hardware with me as I bought a netbook 2months ago (running [Mageia](\%22http://www.mageia.org/\%22)).

See you there, guys, lots of fun expected !
