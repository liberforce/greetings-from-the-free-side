The more I go on the [frenchYahoo Questions/Answers](http://fr.answers.yahoo.com/question/), the more I' m amazed about human stupidity. Peoplethat want us to do their homework. Others that don't even try to understandwhat the source of the problems can be (your computer crashes ? (Buy moreRAM|Reinstall Windows|Buy another computer)). Lots of"Windows-is-a-piece-of-shit-but-I-still-use-it", and some linuxzealots...

Browsing aimlessly on the "Computers & Internet " section if prettyinstructive about the average Windows user and it difficulties. Most seenquestions are:

-   My computer is slow? Why?
-   How can I get rid of these popups that appear for p0rn sites?
-   My computer gets ages to start up.
-   Emule: (takes ages to download a movie| where can I download it ? | has lowId | is donwloading illegal ?)
-   How can I switch back from IE7 to IE6 (yes, really plenty of this one)
-   I've got a virus. What can I do?
-   I deleted some precious file on my computer. How can I get them back (froma poor girl that just had defragmented her disk after having deleted thefiles)

It seems computing still has a lot of challenges for the 21st century. Muchmore challenging than graphical eye candy, burning windows or 3D cubes: justmaking a computer being usable for the masses.
