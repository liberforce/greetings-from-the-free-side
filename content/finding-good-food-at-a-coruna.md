Yesterday night, after a long walk to find a restaurant open on a Sunday, and
two of the nice places found on the internet turning out to be closed (as in
"the restaurant doesn't even exist anymore"), we eventually found the
[Culuca](http://www.culuca.com).

On the eleven people of our group, seems everyone was satisfied with the food
quality. We had been looking for a while to a place where we could eat some
[polpo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus), and had mostly given up when we
found this restaurant/bar. Luckily, they also serve some great *polpo a la
plancha* (12,90€), other meals being really good too, and less expensive. With
the wine (15€ for a bottle of galician red wine), and dessert (cheese cake
around 3.50€, [petit gâteau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petit_G%C3%A2teau) at
4.50€), the bill you should expect is around 19€ per person.

Here's the [Culuca on GoogleMaps](http://goo.gl/maps/X9Y85), and here's our
former polpo friend :-)
