Yesterday night, after a long walk to find a restaurant open on a Sunday,and two of the nice places found on the internet turning out to be closed (asin "the restaurant doesn't even exist anymore"), we eventually found the[Culuca](\%22http://www.culuca.com\%22).

On the eleven people of our group, seems everyone was satisfied with thefood quality. We had been looking for a while to a place where we could eatsome [polpo](\%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus\%22),and had mostly given up when we found this restaurant/bar. Luckily, they alsoserve some great *polpo a la plancha* (12,90€), other meals being reallygood too, and less expensive. With the wine (15€ for a bottle of galician redwine), and dessert (cheese cake around 3.50€, [petit gâteau](\%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petit_G%C3%A2teau\%22) at 4.50€),the bill you should expect is around 19€ per person.

Here's the [Culuca on GoogleMaps](\%22http://goo.gl/maps/X9Y85\%22), and here's our former polpo friend :-)
