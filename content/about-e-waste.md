Each time I hear about the [OLPC](http://laptop.org) project(just an example, I personnaly have nothing against it) and other widespreadelectronics, I wonder if the invasion of electronics in our everyday life is a[blessingor a curse](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/toxics/electronics), especially for developping countries...

There are plenty of examples of these poisonous devices. For example, the[iPhone contains hazardous chemicals](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/news/iPhone-test-hazardous-toxic-chemicals151007), according to greenpeace. They alsogive an [ecologic ranking of world electronics leaders](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up), based on their lack ofhazardous substances and takeback and recycle of their products.

Guess what ? [Nintendo, Philips and Microsoft are the worse](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/news/greener-electronics-ranking-6-291107) on this aspect.

-   Nintendo: 0/10
-   Philips: 2/10
-   Microsoft: 2.7/10

So why is Sony is on the best pupils, while their PS3 is a power hungrybeast ? And why the Nintendo with its power friendly Wii is so far (see this[Wii / PS3 / XBoxpower consumption benchmark](http://www.hardcoreware.net/reviews/review-356-1.htm)) ? This should be part of the study, shouldn'tit ?

Yes, of course, ti makes sense. Especially here in France, where the biggestpart of our electricity is nuclear. Thousands of PS3 vs thousands of Wii arefar better on this aspect. But getting rid of hazardous chemicals is the veryfirst step... This post is not about PS3 against Wii. It's all about choice.And the choices we have to make each day are pretty hard. So each time you seethat new electronic gadget, just think and ask yourself: ***Do Ireally need this ? Is it really worthwhile ?***

Plenty of [these children](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guiyu)will thank you.

**Update:**  
[Arstechnica has doubts on this study](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071127-greenpeaces-green-electronics-guide-undermined-by-minimal-research-effort.html).
