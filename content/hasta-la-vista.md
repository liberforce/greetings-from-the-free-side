Today, Windows Vista has been released. There's lots of people starting tomake everyone think they need it, even if they don't know why. In France,Microsoft even paid 600,000€ to the major private french TV channel (TF1) tohave a presenter showing Vista for about 2 minutes. It avoids the costs of aspecific local publicity.  
  
Thay also paid to have some giant Vista stuff displayed on the CNIT of LaDéfense (big technology center near Paris) the same day that the [Solutions Linux](\%22http://www.solutionslinux.fr/fr/\%22) event a few blocks fromthere!  
  
What I thought was amazing, is that some people complain that we can't buy acomputer without Windows. They use this software/hardware couple to force youto buy the software when you buy new hardware.  
  
With Vista this has changed: it is so resource hungry, that people think ofbuying a new computer just to have Vista shipped with it.
