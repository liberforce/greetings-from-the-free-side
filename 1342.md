This is my [finalrank](\%22http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=3716\%22) (among 7897 contestants) on the last Artificial Intelligence challengeon [aichallenge.org](\%22http://aichallenge.org\%22). That isnot the best result ever, and I'm a bit disapointed as I was aiming for the top500 but I'm fairly new to the AI world...

I definitely had difficulties in chosing between developping my ownalgorithms or seeing what was seen as interesting directions to explore, likethe [anti-objects](\%22http://www.cs.colorado.edu/%7Eralex/papers/PDF/OOPSLA06antiobjects.pdf\%22)approach. Being a noob in the AI field, the Wikipedia articles on pathfindingalgorithms were extremely useful, as well as some Linux Magazine articles onthe same field.

Unfortunaltely, I became less active a few weeks before the end, as a workcolleague had a much better program on his first attempt, while I still hadworked a great amount of time on that... Good lesson for next time: the onlycompetitor I'm trying to surpass is myself. The end of the contest being atChristmas, I couldn't try to catch up, as I was late in buying the Christmaspresents too :-).

The version that was used for the final tournament was version 12, even if Ihad since then done some small improvements and bug fixing. The whole code isavailable on [github](\%22https://github.com/liberforce/termite\%22), underthe [WTFPL 2.0](\%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL\%22) license.

My overal stats:

-   1342 amont 7897 (top 17% of contestants - with an undefined amount ofreally active contestants)
-   77th French contestant among 295 (top 27%).
-   35th C user among 248 (top 15%)

I learned a lot of things and had lots of fun, so expect me to come back onthe next contest, with better basics ;-)
