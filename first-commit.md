Finally, 4 years and 5 months after my first contibution to GNOME (the[JoinGnome](\%22http://live.gnome.org/action/recall/JoinGnome?action=recall&rev=1\%22)page of the wiki), I did my first commit in the GNOME repositories. It's beenquite a nice trip since these old days. I finally applied to an account, so youwon't hear me again telling you "no, I can't commit my patch, I don't havecommit rights". I hope I won't f\*ck things up, especially with my little gitknowledge. Now let me grow [these stats](\%22https://cia.vc/stats/author/liberforce\%22) !
