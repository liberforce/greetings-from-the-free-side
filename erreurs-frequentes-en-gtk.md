I give a hand in several computing forums(mainly nowadays developpez.com in french, and stackoverflow.com in english),mostly about GNOME, GTK, or C programming.  
  
Let's focus on GTK. People asking some advice on these sites are often startingto learn GTK. From my experience, the root causes of most of their problems areoften the same:  
  
1. Not respecting the prototype of a signal's callback  
  
2. Failing to understand how a message pump works  
(shovel)
