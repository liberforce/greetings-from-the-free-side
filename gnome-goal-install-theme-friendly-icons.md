The ["Installtheme-friendly icons" GNOME goal](\%22http://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals/AppIcon\%22) is currently going on. This one hadpreviously been announced, and partially completed, but the guidelines were[buggy](\%22http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=362604\%22). So if youare a brave hacker-wanabe, and you are interested in helping the GNOME Desktopto improve its consistency, then here's a task for you !  
  
***Spread the word about this goal !***  
  
Hopefully, [Brian Pepple](\%22http://bpepple.wordpress.com/\%22) has startedto squash these dirty bugs, but he definitely needs your help ! On the bestcase, a simple 3 lines patch will be enough, so you can learn [how to submit your firstpatch](\%22http://live.gnome.org/GnomeLove/SubmittingPatches\%22). On the (other) best case, the whole task needs to be completed, andyou can then learn how to make an application behave nice with icon themes, sothat a theme can override the application's icon.  
  
So thank you Brian, and if you, reader, have some spare time, help Brian toimprove consistency in the GNOME Desktop !
